# Multidimensional-tectonic-discrimination-diagrams
In this repository you will find scripts to develop multidimensional tectonic discrimination diagrams based in log-ratios transformations proposed by Verma et al. and Agrawal et al.

This scripts comes with their respective .csv template file. 

Note: if you change the template file, please change the name in quotation marks (" ") in the lines 11 and 84 from each file, or well, in the variable D or where you find the command _read.csv_

If you have any doubt about using this templates you can see the tutorial video in the YouTube page of Platicando de la Tierra (https://www.youtube.com/@platicandodelatierra)

Thanks for using these scripts hope that works for you teaching and research. Keep tune for more diagrams and scripts !
